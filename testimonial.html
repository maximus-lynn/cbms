                <p><span>&ldquo;</span>
                    John Jefferies’s business CBMS did the work for us. He and his team are undoubtedly 
                    excellent in terms of craft and customer relations and we unhesitatingly commend him to 
                    you. Should Ceri decide to proceed with the kitchen extension I suggest that you ask her 
                    to invite CBMS to tender.

                    my claim for storm damage, my wife &amp; I are very grateful to you (Dawn) and John’s 

                    professional support in responding to the several enquiries made by the company 

                    and generously thank you. We had in mind sending you a bunch of flowers in 

                    acknowledgment of your help but decided to send the enclosed voucher which we hope 

                    you will spend of something for yourself.

                <p><span>&ldquo;</span>
                    I suppose the final proof of how successful an extension has been, lies in how well 

                    the new work fits in with the old. I know that this isn’t always easy to achieve (there 

                    are no end of horrendous examples all around Redland) but your efforts have paid off 

                    handsomely in that, unless you know the house before you could well be fooled into 

                    thinking it was originally constructed as it now is.
